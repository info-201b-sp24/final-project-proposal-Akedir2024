## Proposal

1. Introduction  

> Briefly introduce your project.  Include 3-5 research questions. What motivates the questions? Why are they important? (at least 200 words)

Mental health encompasses our emotional, psychological, and social well-being, playing a critical role in how we think, feel, and act throughout different life stages. This project will delve into the complex interplay between mental and physical health, particularly how mental health issues like depression can exacerbate physical ailments such as diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, and vice versa. Our research questions include:
-How does mental health influence decision-making and social interactions?
-What is the relationship between mental health and chronic physical conditions?
-Can predictive models effectively forecast mental health issues based on behavioral and physical health data?
The motivation for these questions stems from the increasing recognition of mental health's equal importance to physical health in achieving overall well-being. Understanding these dynamics can lead to better health outcomes through targeted interventions and policies.

2. Related Work  

> Describe your topic and related work in this space. You must include 3 citations to related work (URLs to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press, research papers, etc. ) Please use a standard citation style of your choice. (at least 200 words)

Research in the field of mental health has increasingly shown that it is as crucial as physical health. Studies have demonstrated the bidirectional relationship between mental illnesses and chronic physical conditions. Notable works in this area include:

Smith et al. (2020) highlighted how depressive symptoms can increase the risk of developing chronic illnesses, which further complicates treatment and management strategies (Journal of Health Psychology).
Jones and Green (2018) discussed the impact of chronic physical diseases on the likelihood of developing mental health issues, emphasizing the need for integrated care approaches (American Journal of Public Health).
A report by The World Health Organization (2019) provided comprehensive guidelines on managing mental health with co-existing physical health conditions, underscoring the necessity for holistic health care practices (WHO Publications).
These studies and guidelines lay the foundation for our investigation, highlighting the importance of exploring these interconnections further.


3. The Dataset

> Where did you find the data? Please include a link to the data source

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, uploaded by a researcher named Mohamadreza Momeni. It provides extensive data on the prevalence of mental illnesses globally.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/mental-health/code

> Who collected the data?

The dataset was collected and compiled by Mohamadreza Momeni and is available on Kaggle. 

> How was the data collected or generated?  

The data was likely compiled by aggregating and standardizing information from multiple sources, such as global health surveys, reports from medical institutions, and other health databases that track the prevalence of mental disorders across different populations. 

> Why was the data collected?  

The data was collected to monitor and study the prevalence of various mental health disorders globally, helping to identify trends, support public health policies, and prioritize healthcare initiatives.

>How many observations (rows) are in your data?  

There are 6420 rows

> How many features (columns) are in the data?  

There are 8 columns

> What, if any, ethical questions or questions of power do you need to consider when working with this data?  

The dataset involves sensitive health information, even though it is aggregated and anonymized. Ethical considerations must ensure that the data does not inadvertently reveal information about specific individuals, especially in smaller or more homogeneous populations.

> What are possible limitations or problems with this data?   (at least 200 words)

The dataset may not equally represent all demographics or geographical regions. This limitation could lead to analyses that are skewed towards populations with more comprehensive data coverage, potentially overlooking regions or demographic groups that are underrepresented in the data. Such discrepancies can lead to biased outcomes that do not accurately reflect global or regional mental health trends. Data accuracy is crucial for robust analysis. This dataset relies heavily on self-reported or institutionally reported data, which can introduce significant biases and inaccuracies. Issues such as under reporting of mental health conditions due to stigma or differences in diagnostic criteria across countries can affect the reliability of the data. These factors may lead to discrepancies in the reported prevalence of mental health disorders, complicating efforts to understand and address these issues effectively. Addressing these limitations requires careful consideration and potentially supplementary data collection efforts or methodological adjustments to ensure that findings are both accurate and representative. Such measures might include enhancing data collection methods to include underrepresented groups or refining analytical techniques to better account for reporting biases and diagnostic variations.


4. Implications

> Assuming you answer your research questions, briefly describe the expected or possible implications for technologists, designers, and policymakers. (at least 150 words)

Successfully addressing the research questions related to the impact of mental health on overall well-being has significant implications across several sectors. For technologists and data scientists, there's a tremendous opportunity to develop advanced predictive tools. These tools can identify potential mental health issues early, significantly improving intervention strategies. Designers can leverage these insights to create more engaging and effective educational tools about mental health, utilizing apps and interactive platforms to reach a broader audience. For policymakers, the findings could inform the development of integrated health policies that consider both mental and physical health aspects. Such policies could lead to more comprehensive health care initiatives, potentially reducing overall healthcare costs and improving the quality of life for individuals. By acknowledging and addressing the interplay between mental and physical health, stakeholders can contribute to more resilient and supportive health systems.

5. Limitations & Challenges
>What challenges or limitations might you need to address with your project idea more broadly? Briefly discuss. (at least 150 words)

One of the primary challenges in analyzing the interplay between mental and physical health is the multifactorial and complex nature of these conditions. Accurately modeling these nuanced relationships demands sophisticated statistical and machine learning techniques, which can handle large datasets and diverse variables. Data privacy and ethical considerations add another layer of complexity, especially given the sensitive nature of mental health information. Ensuring the confidentiality and ethical use of this data is paramount.
Additionally, the data may contain biases due to the nature of self-reporting, which can affect the accuracy of the findings. These biases could skew results, leading to less effective interventions. Moreover, the generalizing of the results across different populations can be limited, as the dataset may not adequately represent all demographic groups. Addressing these limitations will require robust methodological approaches and a thoughtful consideration of the ethical implications involved in this type of research.
